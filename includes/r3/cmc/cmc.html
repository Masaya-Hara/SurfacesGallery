	<h3>Constant mean curvature surfaces</h3>
	<p>
		Constant mean curvature surfaces (CMC surfaces for short) in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be locally obtained via <strong>DPW method</strong>.
		For the details, we kindly refer the readers to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0602570" class="gallery-link">WISKY note</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926224517300591" class="gallery-link">Ogata-Yasumoto(2017)</a> for examples.
		In the DPW algorithm, we can construct CMC surfaces from a <strong>holomorphic potential</strong>, of the form
		\[ \xi = \sum_{j=-1}^{\infty} \xi_j(z) \lambda^j dz, \]
		where $\lambda \in \mathbb{S}^1 \subset \mathbb{C}$ and the $\xi_j(z)$ are $2 \times 2$ matrices the are independent of $\lambda$ and are holomorphic functions of a coordinate $z$ of some Riemann surface $\Sigma$.
		Furtheremore, the $\xi_j(z)$ are traceless and diagonal (resp. off-diagonal) when $j$ is even (resp. odd).
		Therefore, we just write the holomorphic potential to obtain each surface in the followings.
