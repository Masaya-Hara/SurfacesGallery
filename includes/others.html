  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Other Galleries</h2>
  <p>Currently, there exist many galleries and repositories related to surfaces (or curves) considered in differential geometry.
  Here, I would like to introduce—albeit without formal permission—some of the websites that I have frequently referred to in my own work.

    <li>Prof. Sisto Baldo,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://profs.scienze.univr.it/~baldo/tjs/" class="gallery-link">Gallery of Minimal Surfaces</a></li>
    <p>
      This site presents an <strong>interactive WebGL-based gallery of minimal surfaces</strong>, allowing users to explore various geometric features such as smoothness, periodicity, and principal curvature directions. Built with Three.js, it enables <strong>real-time manipulation</strong> (rotation, zoom, display toggles) of surfaces. A broad range of examples is included, from classical to more advanced surfaces like the Schwarz P-surface and the Gyroid. The focus lies on <strong>visual intuition</strong>, while theoretical explanations are kept minimal.

    <li>Prof. Robert Ferréol,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://mathcurve.com/surfaces.gb/surfaces.shtml" class="gallery-link">MATHCURVE.COM</a></li>
    <p>
      This website serves as a <strong>comprehensive visual and analytic catalog of mathematical surfaces</strong>, both classical and modern. Each surface is accompanied by a brief explanation of its <strong>defining equations, geometric properties, origin, and historical context</strong>. It is especially useful for those seeking a <strong>rapid overview of a surface's mathematical background</strong>, combining concise theory with illustrative graphics. <br>
      Although interactive 3D models are not provided, <strong>explicit parametrizations are frequently available</strong>, offering precise mathematical formulations of the surfaces.
      This site is <strong>highly recommended for anyone interested in differential geometry and related fields</strong>, from students to active researchers.(Personally, I have learned a great deal from this resource over the years.)

    <li>Prof. Shoichi Fujimori,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://home.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/fujimori/min_inR3-j.html" class="gallery-link">Minimal Surface Gallery</a></li>
    <p>
      This site offers a <strong>clear and detailed Japanese-language introduction to minimal surfaces</strong>, including their definitions, geometric interpretations, and classical examples such as the helicoid and catenoid. The exposition is supported by numerous diagrams and formulas, making it a <strong>valuable resource for students and educators</strong> seeking to understand the <strong>fundamentals of minimal surface theory</strong> in Japanese.

    <li>Prof. Xah Lee,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://virtualmathmuseum.org/" class="gallery-link">3DXM Virtual Math Museum</a></li>
    <p>
      The Virtual Math Museum is a <strong>visual archive of mathematical objects</strong>, featuring curves, surfaces, and polyhedra in an <strong>interactive and pedagogically oriented</strong> interface. Educational usability is emphasized, with intuitive controls and explanatory notes accompanying each exhibit. It is particularly suitable as a <strong>learning tool for secondary and undergraduate education</strong>, and for general audiences interested in mathematical aesthetics. <br>
      In addition, the site includes more advanced content such as <strong>minimal surfaces</strong>, <strong>pseudospherical surfaces</strong>, and <strong>algebraic surfaces</strong>. These entries are accompanied by explanatory notes and scholarly references, making the platform <strong>equally valuable for graduate students and researchers</strong>.

    <li>Prof. Xah Lee,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://xahlee.info/math/math_index.html" class="gallery-link">Xah Math</a></li>
    <p>
      This site is a <strong>personal compilation of visualizations</strong> spanning topics in algebra, geometry, topology, and vector calculus. Though somewhat eclectic in organization, it showcases numerous <strong>Java-based applets</strong> for interactive exploration (note: many may no longer be supported by modern browsers). The site is notable for its <strong>unique visual approach</strong>, making it a reference for creative mathematical expression online.

    <li>Prof. Mario B. Schulz,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://mbschulz.github.io/index.html" class="gallery-link">Geometric Analysis Gallery</a></li>
    <p>
      This gallery focuses on <strong>constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces, Willmore surfaces</strong>, and related geometric structures, with an emphasis on <strong>symmetry, periodicity, and visual elegance</strong>. The site offers high-quality illustrations based on current research, combining mathematical rigor with aesthetic sensitivity. It is particularly <strong>valuable for researchers and graduate students</strong> interested in contemporary geometric modeling.
    </p>
    <li>Prof. Nich Schmitt,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.math.uni-tuebingen.de/user/nick/gallery/Delaunay.html" class="gallery-link">Geometrie Werkstatt</a></li>
    <p>
      This site provides <strong>graphical representations of CMC surfaces in Riemannian space forms, pseudospherical surfaces, and Willmore surfaces</strong>, accompanied by references and mathematical context. The <strong>visual quality of the graphics is especially striking</strong>, supporting both intuitive and formal understanding. Some 3D models are distributed in <strong>.jnlp (Java Web Start) format</strong>, which may require legacy Java support and are not compatible with modern browsers—<strong>care is needed when attempting to view these models</strong>.

    <li>Prof. Nich Schmitt,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gang.umass.edu/gallery/cmc/cmcgallery-toc.html" class="gallery-link">The GANG Gallery of Constant Mean Curvature Surfaces</a></li>
    <p>
      This gallery, maintained by the <strong>Geometry and Graphics Group (GANG)</strong>, is a <strong>substantial visual and academic archive of constant mean curvature surfaces</strong>. Surfaces are organized by category, with accompanying descriptions and high-quality illustrations. It serves as a <strong>starting point for both theoretical inquiry and visual reference</strong>, particularly suited for specialists and researchers in differential geometry.

    <li>Prof. Matthias Weber,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://minimalsurfaces.blog/" class="gallery-link">Minimal Surface Repository</a></li>
    <p>
      This blog-style site provides <strong>ongoing updates and visual content related to minimal surfaces and their generalizations</strong>. The entries often feature <strong>experimental and artistic renderings</strong>, blending creative design with mathematical structure. Rather than a systematic theoretical exposition, it emphasizes <strong>aesthetic exploration and visual experimentation</strong>, appealing to those interested in the intersection of geometry and art.
