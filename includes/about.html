  <h2 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Purpose of This Site</h2>
  <p>
	As mentioned in Others as well, there already exist many galleries and repositories of surfaces in differential geometry, and the examples I can provide represent only a small portion, with many overlapping cases.

	However, I believe that having multiple websites publish repositories of surfaces from different perspectives can invigorate each field and would by no means have a negative impact.

	With due respect to the existing galleries and repositories, I hope to contribute to an environment where any student and researcher can more easily access a broader range of data.
  </p>

  <h2 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Available Resources</h2>
  <p>This website serves as a repository for the surfaces I have created to date.
	If you find it troublesome to generate surfaces yourself, or are simply interested in exploring them without creating your own, this site is ideal for you!
  </p>
  <p>You can browse through the available surfaces and click “View in 3D” to launch the interactive viewer.
	For every surface presented here, the source data is also available via GitHub.<br>
  You will find thumbnail <code>.jpg</code> images, <code>.obj</code> and <code>.mtl</code> files for the 3D viewer, and when available, accompanying Mathematica files. (The Mathematica files are expected to be compatible with version 12.2.0.0 or later.)</p>

  <p>As someone interested in differential geometry (you can reach me at mhara8360[at]gmail.com), I have so far only created relatively simple examples—mostly related to CMC surfaces in space forms.</p>
  <p>Well-known surfaces that are not yet included on this site may be added along with their data if I get the opportunity to create them in the future.</p>
