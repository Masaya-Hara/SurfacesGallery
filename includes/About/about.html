	<p>This website serves as a repository for the surfaces I have created to date.</p>
	<p>If you find it troublesome to generate surfaces yourself, or are simply interested in exploring them without creating your own, this site is ideal for you!</p>
	<p>You can browse through the available surfaces and click “View in 3D” to launch the interactive viewer.</p>
	<p>For every surface presented here, the source data is also available via GitHub.<br>
	You will find thumbnail <code>.jpg</code> images, <code>.obj</code> and <code>.mtl</code> files for the 3D viewer, and when available, accompanying Mathematica files.</p>
	<p>The Mathematica files are expected to be compatible with version 12.2.0.0 or later.</p>

	<p>As someone interested in differential geometry (you can reach me at mhara[at]gmail.com), I have so far only created relatively simple examples—mostly related to CMC surfaces in space forms.</p>
	<p>Well-known surfaces that are not yet included on this site may be added along with their data if I get the opportunity to create them in the future.</p>
